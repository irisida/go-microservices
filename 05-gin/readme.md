# Mocking

Mocking is a way of extending what we have done in the previous section. To successfully mock our system parts well we need to think about the structure of the project.
- service reshuffle to split / clarify
- adds code to controller but clarity is greater
- separates functional use, but allows for inclusion in the package.
