# Basic WebServer with Go

Below we have an example of a trivial webserver with `Go`. Although this is not something that we would use in production it's useful in the sense that it covers the very basics of implementing a web server in `Go` using just the `net/http` pack and the `HandleFunc` method. There are many available framewors written for implementing webservices in Go and underneath them all you'll find basics with the `net/http` package such as this we can see here.
